luaagent: Lua-based Agent Environment
=====================================

The behavior engine assumes a three layer separation of the robot behavior
control software. This package provides an environment to formulate high-level
agent programs using hybrid state machines in Lua.

Essentially this environment lifts the approach of the skiller to the higher
level program. It communicates with the skiller and uses it as the sole way of
executing actions with the robot hardware.

Requirements
------------
It builds on utility packages from the behavior_engine stack. Additionally,
it uses actionlib via actionlib_lua to instruct and monitor the skiller.

Documentation
-------------
Guides and howtos are currently work in progress. For now we would like to
refer to the example set of agents provided in the herb_agents package.
